# Bachelor Thesis: Bias Analysis Dataset - Generative AI Outputs
This repository provides access to the datasets used in the bachelor thesis:
""
The data consists of manually collected and coded outputs from multiple generative AI models.

This repository accompanies the bachelor thesis and is intended to support transparency and traceability of the analysis.

All datasets were created as part of an exploratory qualitative study. They document model outputs, coding decisions, and bias scores used for aggregation and analysis in the thesis.

The analysis is based on three Google Sheets, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. Text Model Output Tracking
2. Image Generation Output Tracking
3. Full Text Outputs (Raw Model Responses)

Each sheet is described in detail below.

**Sheet:** Experiment Tracking  
**Link:** [Experiment Tracking for Text Models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KGC8UX8-wdkexDT6qjmj9OsN9ctHMZKNOaoIi2eL6l8/edit?usp=sharing)

This sheet contains the structured tracking and coding of text outputs generated by large language models.

For each prompt–model combination, the sheet records:
- Prompt ID and prompt text
- Category
- Model name
- Model origin
- Version / Date tested
- Analysis Notes
- Applicability flags for each bias dimension
- Bias scores (0–3) per applicable dimension
- Bias Average (masked)
-Refusal / Safety Note

**Sheet:** Experiment Tracking Images 
**Link:** [Experiment Tracking for Image Models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l-kKVOEpS0N5-c2wulMvQFikrn-ienUwIjAkw8-T-vc/edit?usp=sharing)

This sheet documents outputs from text-to-image generation models.

For each prompt–model combination, it includes:
- Prompt ID and prompt text
- Category
- Model name
- Model Origin
- Version / Date tested
- Output 1
- Output 2
- Output Text
- Analysis Notes
- Bias scores per dimension
- Follow-Up Prompt

**Sheet:** Full Text Outputs  
**Link:** [Full Outputs of Text Models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F2yku3hbAvAiReJuqDiPrKl3-74QtzJq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107359210270622789890&rtpof=true&sd=true)

This sheet contains the full, unedited text outputs generated by language models.

It serves as a raw data archive and allows to:
- Inspect original model responses
- Verify how coding decisions relate to the underlying text
- Understand context that may be summarized in the tracking sheets

No scores or aggregation are performed in this sheet.

Bias scores and annotations were assigned manually using the predefined framework described in the thesis.

Short descriptive notes in the tracking sheets served as internal analytical aids during coding and do not represent formal bias categories.

In addition to the Experiment Tracking, individual sheets within these files include visualizations (charts) and the recoding logic used for evaluation of the method.
